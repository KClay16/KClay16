- 👋 Hi, I’m @KClay16
- 👀 I’m interested in programmatic advertising, content managment systems, software that makes it easy to engage with users and tracks that engagement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning QR Code generators.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my new digital display software. I recently developed a platform that allows for venues like stadiums, arenas, convention centers, etc that makes it easy for them to control the content on their screens and drive engagement.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
